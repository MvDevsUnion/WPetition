## Petition Body (English)

We, the citizens of the Republic of Maldives, respectfully submit this petition to address the critical lack of a modern, comprehensive framework to protect the fundamental rights, privacy, and digital security of the Maldivian people.

In the rapidly evolving digital age, personal data including names, contact details, location data, and communication records is constantly being collected, processed, and stored by both private companies and public entities. The current legal framework in the Maldives is inadequate to safeguard these assets, leaving citizens vulnerable to privacy breaches, misuse of data, and exploitation. The absence of robust regulation has already led to severe real-world consequences, including high-profile incidents involving the unauthorized access, sale, and mass leakage of citizens’ personal and confidential information.

The widespread practice of sending unsolicited promotional SMS and messages is a clear example of this data processing abuse, constituting a daily intrusion into the personal lives and privacy of citizens, leading to significant disruption and eroding the quality of mobile communication.

A. Enactment of a Comprehensive Data Protection Act (Inspired by Global Standards)

We respectfully request the People's Majlis to initiate, deliberate upon, and enact a dedicated Data Protection Act that establishes high standards for the lawful processing of personal data, drawing upon globally recognized best practices, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to ensure the Maldives’ framework is robust and future-proof.

1 . The Act must include, but not be limited to, the following core principles:

- Fundamental Rights of the Data Subject: Guaranteeing the rights of individuals to:
- Access their personal data.
- Rectify inaccurate data.
- Erase their data (Right to be Forgotten).
- Portability of their data.

2 . Lawful Basis for Processing: Mandating that all processing of personal data must be based on a clear, explicit, and informed consent or other defined legal grounds. The use of pre-checked boxes or presumed consent must be prohibited.

3 . Specific Mandate on Electronic Marketing Consent (Unsolicited SMS):

- The Act must specifically define the use of personal data (such as a phone number) for promotional SMS or electronic messaging as a form of marketing that requires prior, specific, and informed Opt-In consent from the subscriber.

- This consent must be separate from any general terms and conditions, ensuring the default position for all promotional communication is Opt-In (where the sender must receive explicit consent) rather than Opt-Out.

- The Act must prohibit the sending of commercial, marketing, or promotional SMS and messages to any subscriber without this specific consent.

4 . Establishment of an Independent Authority: Creating a well-resourced and independent Data Protection Authority (DPA) with the power to:

- Enforce the Act.
- Investigate complaints.
- Impose significant and effective penalties for non-compliance.

4 . Data Breach Obligations: Making it mandatory for data controllers to promptly notify the DPA and affected individuals of any significant data breach.

We urge the Honourable People's Majlis to recognize the profound importance of digital privacy and the necessity of safeguarding citizens from intrusive communication. We respectfully pray that the Majlis accepts this petition, refers it to the appropriate Standing Committee for thorough review, and takes the necessary legislative steps to enact the requested Data Protection Act, incorporating the mandatory Opt-In policy for all promotional communication.

We look forward to the Majlis’s favourable consideration of this matter of national importance.
